# world-cup-viz-comparison

Simple comparison of using dataframe libraries and data vizualization in Python vs. Elixir, using Jupyter and Livebook notebooks.

Currently, Livebook notebooks don't have the same level of support for rendering on GitHub as Jupyter notebooks do, so you may not be able to see all outputs on GitHub.

However, you can always run the Livebook yourself:
